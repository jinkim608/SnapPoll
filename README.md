##Overview

Instead of writing out all the answer choices for a poll, attach a picture reference and ask a question!

Your friends can indicate their responses by a simple tap on the picture.

More thoughts on use cases and architecture is [in the wiki](https://github.com/jinkim608/SnapPoll/wiki).

##Android Client
